### My dotfiles

You may also want to checkout my [dotfiles](https://github.com/sierratecnologia/dotfiles), specifically the aliases for all these files which are here: [github.com/sierratecnologia/dotfiles/blob/master/.dockerfunc](https://github.com/sierratecnologia/dotfiles/blob/master/.dockerfunc).

## Contributing

I try to make sure each Dockerfile has a command at the top to document running it,
if a file you are looking at does not have a command, please
pull request it!


### Using the `Makefile`

```

run                            Run a Dockerfile from the command at the top of the file (ex. DIR=telnet).
